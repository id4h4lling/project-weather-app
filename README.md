# Weather App

This weeks project was to make a weather app fetching api:s. 
We used Berlin as the default city. 


## The problem

We followed the plan doing the first steps together. Wi split in three teams based on our working hours, did our parts separately finishing with a group session where we merge all the branches. 
The site is responsive and changes colors and icons depending on weather.
